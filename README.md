# eclipse-configuration

Eclipse configuration used across StarChart Labs projects.

Currently, Eclipse is the supported IDE for development of StarChart Labes projects. You should import the standard formatting and save settings:

- `Java > CodeStyle > Cleanup` is imported from cleanup.xml
- `Java > CodeStyle > Formatter` is imported from codeformatter.xml
- `Java > CodeStyle > Code Templates` is imported from codetemplates.xml

It is also recommended to turn on "save actions", under the Java Editor settings, to format saved lines and perform other cleanup operations
